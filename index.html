    Welcome to my site!

  <p>
    I'm Pierce:

    If you're thinking, "wow, this website seems pretty basic", that's the goal for now :)<br>
    This site is written 100% by hand, with no frameworks or libraries: to both learn about the way that site data is structured and rendered, but also to minimise the indirection and bloat. This site loads and renders quickly with no fluff <small>(just as the internet was intended)</small>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're looking for more information about me, and understandably don't want to spend time reading my waffle, please feel free to head straight to my <a href="./about/">About page</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Admittedly, a part of the reason the site is written in pure HTML & CSS, is to accommodate users that may have JavaScript disabled, since it's not uncommon in the Cyber Security space. I'm also a believer in the idea that the basic functions, e.g. navigation, should work perfectly without JavaScript, and that JavaScript is only there to enhance the experience, rather than to be a pre-requisite.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like a site built with purpose, for a purpose, and not sites filled with colour and animation, looking like an iridescent disco... often at the cost of usability and performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://bruno-simon.com/" class="labelled" title="Last Accessed: 03-02-2025">Bruno Simon's site</a> is a good counter-example: it couldn't run smoothly on a less powerful device, but perfectly fulfils its purposes of novelty, fun, and showcasing his skills; still, I don't think it's the most usable site, but that's easily overlooked in light of how fun it is to drive the little car around :D
  </p>
  <p>
    That being said, I'll likely be introducing a framework in the future, to reduce code redundancy and provide a more feature-rich site (v2), while keeping it quite minimal, but for now, it's all hand-made. Though, as you can tell, I'm still quite opinionated.
