> 私 (read: "watashi") is a more formal personal pronoun in Japanese

## What

This is a more formal personal website, detailing the professional information that I'd like to present.

## Why

Originally I was planning on using the SvelteKit framework to create a static site, but based on the static nature of the content, I decided that there are simpler ways to create a website, especially if I wanted to create one quickly.

Thus I decided to go back to basics, for now, to be able to put out a minimum viable product, and perhaps revisit using a framework for more complex functionality later on.

This way, the hardest part of setting up this site would be getting this site running smoothly on GitHub Pages, with an SSL certificate, and playing nicely with my DNS Provider.
