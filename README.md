# 私のページ (My Page)

> 私 (read: "watashi") is a more formal personal pronoun in Japanese

## Why

This is a more formal personal website, detailing the information I'd like to present to potential employers.

## What

This is just a simple, performant, and professional-style personal website to introduce myself and showcase a selection of my projects (optimising for Lighthouse performance score).

Originally I was planning to use SvelteKit to generate a static site, but based on the static nature of the content, I decided that there are simpler ways to create a website, especially if I wanted to create one quickly.

Especially as an exercise in the basics of website-building, I've quickly come to understand why frameworks are so widely used...\
Nonetheless I've decided to go back to basics, for now, to be able to put out a minimum viable product, but may migrate to or write my own simple framework later on.

This way, the hardest part of setting up this site is getting this site running smoothly on GitHub Pages, with an SSL certificate, and getting it to play nicely with my DNS Provider :}
